## Description
<p align="center" >
This project shows a simple landing page, where clicking the "Open" button, a modal will appear showing a chat window, where a supposed student may have a       conversation with the teacher, even including files with a drag'n'drop feature over the modal. Only the student may write messages, but changing the type of origin of the own message teacher will as well"
